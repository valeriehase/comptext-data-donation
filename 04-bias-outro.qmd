## 1) Bias in Data Donation Studies

## What is bias?

**Definition** üí°: *Deviations from the true value of a theoretical concept introduced by its measurement* [@peytchev_2013]

-   Non-systematic errors: random deviations influence variance of estimates
-   Systematic errors (or: **bias**): depend on omitted variables

üëâ Bias can influence descriptive results but also attenuate/inflate inferential conclusions.

## What is bias?

-   Errors in representation: *Who participates in data donation studies?*
-   Errors in measurement: *Which latent concepts can we measure with data donation studies?*

## Errors in representation

For example ...

::: incremental
-   **Coverage error**: Who is (not) represented in the sampling frame? (e.g., social media users vs. YouTube users)

-   **Sampling error**: Who is (not) represented in the sample (e.g., non-probability samples)

-   **Non-response error**: Who does (not) want to participate in the data donation?

-   **Compliance error**: Who is (not) able to participate in the data donation?

*What do you think: Which participant characteristics may correlate with non-response or non-compliance?* ü§î

*Any ideas (from your discipline): How can we quantify/address errors in representation?* ü§î
:::

## Errors in representation: Quantification

-   Response rates across study stages
-   Para data as quality indicators (e.g., speeding)
-   Non-response bias (e.g. traits of survey vs. donation participants)

## Errors in representation: Solutions

-   **A posteriori strategies**:

    -   Infrastructure: Integration in probability-based panels

    -   Survey design strategies (e.g., incentives, study framing)

    -   DDT design (e.g. UX-perspective)

-   **Post hoc strategies**:

    -   Para data (e.g., quality indicators like speeding)

    -   Statistical modeling [e.g., weighting, see @pak_correcting_2022]

## Errors in representation: Solutions

For now: limited studies, limited success of existing solutions

*What do you think: How could errors in measurements sneak into data donation studies?* ü§î
:::

## Errors in measurement

For example ...

::: incremental
-   **Construct (in-)validity**: How do DDP variables relate to latent measurements? (e.g., likes vs. political participation)

-   **Measurement error**: How correct is data in our DDP? (e.g., missing data)

-   **Extraction error**: Did we extract all relevant files and variables?

*Any ideas (from your discipline): How can we quantify/address errors in measurements?* ü§î
:::

## Errors in measurement: Quantification

-   Para data (e.g., failed uploads)
-   Correlation between self-reported and observed behavior
-   Multi Trait Multi Method (MTMM) approaches [@cernat_etal2024]
-   Estimation of misclassification effects [@teblunthuis_etal2024]

## Errors in representation: Solutions

-   **A posteriori strategies**:

    -   Talk to everyone (e.g., IRB, Data Strward)

    -   Repeated testing & DDP download

    -   Simulate downstream errors [@bosch_etal2024]

-   **Post hoc strategies**:

    -   Multiverse approaches

    -   Statistical error correction [@teblunthuis_etal2024]

    -   Error documentation [@gebru_etal2021]

## 2) What's next for data donation studies?

![Source: Image by Markus Winkler via Unsplash](images/methods.jpg){fig-alt="image of lupe" fig-align="left" width="300"}

## The road ahead I: Advancing the method

-   Multimodal & cross-platform data üì∏ [@wedel_etal2024]

-   In-tool, local classification (e.g., local SML/LLMs?)

-   Workflow/UX-perspective

![Source: Image by DariuszSankowski via Pixabay](images/future1.jpg){fig-alt="Image of multimedia data" fig-align="left" width="200"}

## The road ahead II: Platforms (and data access) as a political tool

-   Platforms do (willingly?) not provide data according to the GDPR/DSA [@hase_etal2024]

-   The EU has started to sanction platforms like X/TikTok

-   DSA may become the subject of larger geo-political debates with the USA [@seiling_etal2025]

![Source: Image by WilliamCho via Pixabay](images/future2.jpg){fig-alt="Image of the Lady of Justice" fig-align="left" width="200"}

## The road ahead III: Can we improve and apply the method?

-   Can the method actually be applied for empirical research? [few examples, like @thorson_etal2021; @wojcieszak_etal2024]

-   Requires interdisciplinary perspectives (e.g., addressing bias, integration in probability-based panels)
