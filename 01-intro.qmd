## What is digital trace data?

**Definition** üí°: *The recording and storing of activities on digital platforms to draw conclusions about digital and analog phenomena*

::: incremental
-   "records of activity (trace data) undertaken through an online information system" [@howison_validity_2011, S. 2]

## What is digital trace data?

**Definition** üí°: *The recording and storing of activities on digital platforms to draw conclusions about digital and analog phenomena*

## Where can we find/collect digital trace data?

::: incremental
-   Apps (e.g., running apps)
-   Social media platforms (e.g., Instagram)
-   Payment systems (e.g., Paypal)
-   Wearable devices (e.g., smart watch)
:::

## Which types of data does this include?

Depending on the data collection method... [@stollfus_computational_2023; @ohme_digital_2024]:

::: incremental
-   Digital user profiles/settings (e.g., privacy settings)
-   Digital activities (e.g., usage, messages, etc.)
-   Digital targeting (e.g., ad exposure, algorithmically inferred interests)
-   Analog activities (e.g., travelling, sleeping, sports)
:::

## Which (latent) constructs can we measure?

::: incremental
-   Internet usage [@parry_etal2021] related to ...
    -   well-being [@ohme_digital_2024]
    -   voting [@bach_etal2021]
-   News usage [@reiss_2023] related to ...
    -   news diversity [@juergens_etal2022]
    -   public opinion formation [@yan_etal2022]
-   Movements related to ...
    -   Mobility during pandemics [@li_etal2021]
    -   Social networks [@sepulvado_etal2022]

## Why are digital traces becoming more populary?

-   Problems with self-reported data (e.g., via survey)

‚ÄúHow many minutes a day do you use the internet to consume news?‚Äù

## Why are digital traces becoming more popular?

-   **Problems with self-reported data (e.g., via survey)**
    -   Self-reported data may be subject to specific bias [@scharkow_accuracy_2016; @parry_etal2021]
    -   Response rates in surveys are declining [@luiten_survey_2020]

## Why are digital traces becoming more popular?

-   **Problems with self-reported data (e.g., via survey)**
-   **Availabillity**
    -   cheap (e.g., via APIs)
    -   large data sets ("big data")

## Why are digital traces becoming more popular?

-   Problems with self-reported data (e.g., via survey)
-   Availabillity

**Be careful**: These "advantages" are often claimed, but **not** empirically proven.

Digital traces are neither necessarily less biased, nor cheaper, or larger (we will discuss this in Session 4Ô∏è‚É£ & 5Ô∏è‚É£).

## (Dis-)advantages of digital trace data

::: incremental
-   ‚úÖ More fine-grained measures due to timestamps
-   ‚úÖ Partly measurement of new variables (e.g., algorithmic inference)
-   ‚ùå Bias due to errors in representation and measurement
-   ‚ùå Implementation can be expensive
-   ‚ùå More data does not mean better data!

Which methods do you know/have you used for collecting digital trace data*?* ü§î
:::

## Platform- and user-centric methods

::: incremental
-   **Platform-centric** (based on platform cooperation)
    -   API [@engel_brief_2021]
    -   Cooperation with platforms [@wagner_etal2023]
-   **User-centric** (based on user cooperation and informed consent)
    -   Data donation [@carriere_etal2024]
    -   Linkage [@sloan_etal2020]
    -   Sensors [@struminskaya_etal2021]
    -   Tracking [@christner_etal2022]
:::

## Platform- and user-centric methods

<div>

-   Restriction of platform-centric methods
    -   Discontinuation of APIs [@freelon_2018]
    -   Concern about bias [@schatto-eckrodt_2022; @ulloa_etal2025]
-   User-centric methods become more popular, given ...
    -   Changes in law (GDPR, DSA)
    -   Ethical considerations (informed consent)

</div>

## Changes in legal contexts

::: incremental
-   EU secures right to own data in Art. 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/))
    -   ‚ÄúThe data subject shall have \[...\] access to the personal data‚Äù (¬ß Art. 15, 1)
    -   ‚ÄúThe controller shall provide a copy of the personal data‚Äù (¬ß Art. 15, 3)
-   According to ¬ß Art. 20, users must receive their data "in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format" (¬ß Art. 20, 1)

üëâ **Solution:** Platforms offer data download packages (DDPs), which users can request and download to inspect data.

üëâ **Consequence**: Researchers uses DDPs as part of user-centric data donation studies.

## Summary: How can we collect digital traces? üìö

-   **Summary**

    -   Central methods including platform-centric methods (e.g., APIs) and user-centric methods (e.g., data donation)

    -   Key differences: control over samples & measurements, legal & ethical contexts
